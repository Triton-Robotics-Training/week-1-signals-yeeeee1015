Question 1: Explain the difference between analog and digital signals.
Digital signals are discrete values, but analog signals have a continuous set of values.

Question 2: Give an example of something that uses digital signals and how it uses it.
Limit switches have only a state of whether or not they are being pressed, which is perfect for digital signals.

Question 3: Give an example of something that uses analog signals and how it uses it.
Servo motors need analog signals. The PWM drives the servo either forward or backward, at different speeds.
